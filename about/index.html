      VilniusRB is a meetup and community of people who like Ruby, based
      in Vilnius.  We meet to talk about things that excite us. That's
      usually related but not limited to Ruby, development in general,
      tools, practices, people and community. We're open-minded, curious
      and always looking for new ways to improve ourselves and the world
      around us.

      Everyone is welcome to participate, either by attending or giving
      a talk themselves. We are very much looking forward to your talk
      proposals, be it a keynote or a 5 minute chat about your latest
      find on the web.

      We meet on <strong>the second Thursday of each month</strong>. If
      you would like to be notified about our community events in advance
      - please register for our newsletter.
