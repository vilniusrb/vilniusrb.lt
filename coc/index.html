    <h4>The Quick Version</h4>
    <p>
      Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
      for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation,
      disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion (or
      lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of meetup
      participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
      appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops,
      parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants
      violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
      meetup at the discretion of the organisers.
    </p>

    <h4>The Less Quick Version</h4>
    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
      age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
      size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
      intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
      recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
      inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
      comply immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
      particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities,
      or other material.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the usergroup
      organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
      warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup and/or any
      future meetups.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
      harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any of the
      team members immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be happy to help participants contact local law
      enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
      experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
      event. We value your attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at meetup and
      workshop venues and usergroup-related social events.
    </p>
